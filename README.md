# Generating a clock signal
The given code gives an illustration of generating clock signal using 2 methods, using initial and always procedures.</br>
In general if no values are assigned to the variables, they will set to a default value of 'x' and will remain the same throughout the simulation. Hence to avoid that, the clocks used are initialized with an initial before simulation. </br>
